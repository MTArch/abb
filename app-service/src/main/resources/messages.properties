swagger.api.description=It is important to standardize the process of identification of an individual across healthcare providers, to ensure that the created medical records are issued to the right individual or accessed by a Health Information User through appropriate consent. \n\
In order to issue a ABHA Number to an individual, one only needs basic demographic details like Name, Year of Birth, Gender. In addition, citizens should be able to update contact information easily. \n\
The ABHA Number will be used for the purposes of uniquely identifying persons, authenticating them, and threading their health records (only with the informed consent of the patient) across multiple systems and stakeholders.\n\
\n\r<b>API Security</b>\n\rYou need Authorization Token and X-HIP-ID to consume APIs.\n<b>Notes:</b>\n\r\
<b>1. For HID creation and authentication, kindly use OIDC. Documentation for the same can be <a href="https://sandbox.ndhm.gov.in/docs/build_phr_app">checked here.</a></b>\n\
<b>2. In case you want to consume the ABHA Number APIs and use creation on your own interface, use authentication methods as OTP only. </b>\n\
<b>3. In order to have access to HealthID APIs, your clientId must have hid role in gateway. So if you want access to these APIs then please request it in your NDHM on-boarding request.</b>\n\
<b>4. In order to have access to Integrated Programs HealthID APIs, your clientId must have integrated_program role in gateway. So if you want access to these APIs then please request it in your NDHM on-boarding request. Also you will need to share integrated program benefit name to be used in this case.</b>\n\
<b>5. When calling APIs, please ensure that Authorization header must have format as <i>Bearer {Token_Value}</i>. Please note that prefix Bearer followed by space before token value.</b>\n\
<b>6. Please use latest version of APIs (currently latest V2) as older version may get depricated soon.</b>\n\
<b>7. Check the state and district codes from LGD directory [click here](https://lgdirectory.gov.in/)</b> \n\
<b>8. Highlighted Changes in the API Version 2 </b> \n\
- Sensitive data(Data like OTP, Aadhaar Number, Password, Username etc) have to be encrypted.\n\
- Data is encrypted by the public certificate. The certificate can be downloaded from the __/v2/auth/cert__ API under __Authentication__ tag in the version 2.\n\
